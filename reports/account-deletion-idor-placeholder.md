This pull request serves as a placeholder for the account deletion vulnerability reported in Issue #58, where any authenticated user can delete another userâ€™s account by modifying the user ID in the /api/users/{user_id} endpoint.

This commit adds a minimal placeholder to fulfill the bug submission requirements.

Awaiting further instructions from the maintainers. Thank you.
