This pull request serves as a placeholder for the vulnerability reported at: https://github.com/AIxBlock-2023/aixblock-ai-dev-platform-public/issues/56

The issue describes how the application allows users to register with any syntactically valid email address without verifying ownership. After signup, users are immediately granted full access to the account — including access to authenticated endpoints — even if they don’t actually control the email address.

This placeholder PR has been created to fulfill the requirement of submitting a pull request from a forked repository.

Looking forward to any further feedback or instructions from the maintainers. Thank you.
